Three scheduled jobs,

Two pushy stacks,

Three scheduled jobs,

Two pushy stacks,

And a node in a red-black tree.



On the fifth day of Winter Break my true love gave to me:

Two pushy stacks,

And a node in a red-black tree.


On the sixth day of Winter Break my true love gave to me:

Six functions calling,

Five big Ohs,

Four linked lists,

Three scheduled jobs,

Two pushy stacks,

And a node in a red-black tree.


On the seventh day of Winter Break my true love gave to me:

Seven doomed brute-forces,

Six functions calling,

Four linked lists,

Three scheduled jobs,

Two pushy stacks,

And a node in a red-black tree.

On the eighth day of Winter Break my true love gave to me:
Eight graphs traversing,
